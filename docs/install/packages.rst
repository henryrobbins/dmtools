Installing dmtools
==================

In this section, we will install the dmtools Python package. But first,
what is a Python package? A Python package is essentially pre-bundled Python
code that provides some functionality. For example, `NumPy`_ is a Python
package (one you will get more familiar with in :ref:`numpy_tutorial`) that
allows for easy manipulation of arrays. Python packages are your friend! They
allow you to easily use other people's code so you never have to re-invent the
wheel and can spend more time being creative.

In installing anaconda, you should now have a program called `pip`_ which stands
for Pip Installs Packages. It is a Python package manager and it is the tool
we will use to install dmtools. Just run the following line.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dmtools

To the verify the installation worked correctly, open a Python prompt by typing
``python`` and then type ``from dmtools import netpbm.`` If you don't get any
error messages, the installation was a success!

.. code-block:: bash

    python
    Python 3.8.8 (default, Apr 13 2021, 12:59:45)
    [Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from dmtools import netpbm
    >>> quit()

Alternatively, you can use `git`_ to maintain the most up-to-date version of
dmtools rather than waiting for each release. Open up a terminal and navigate
to the directory where you want to store your local version of dmtools. For
instructions on navigating directories in the terminal, see
:ref:`python_tutorial`. Then, type the commands

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/henryrobbins/dmtools.git
    cd dmtools
    pip install -e .

This will clone the dmtools repository and then download it as a python package
you can use like any other. Any time you wish to pull the latest changes,
navigate to your dmtools directory and run

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull origin master
