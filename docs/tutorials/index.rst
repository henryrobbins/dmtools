Tutorials
=========

This section includes a few tutorials to get you up and running and using
dmtools effectively. The :ref:`python_tutorial` assumes you have installed
`VS Code`_. The first tutorial walks you through this installation. The next
two tutorials provide a quick introduction to Python and the `NumPy`_ python
package. If you are familiar with all of these tools, you can skip to the
final tutorial which provides an introduction to dmtools.
